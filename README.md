# TheGame (awaiting for proposals about game naming)
Browser game based on fantasy 'auto-chess' settings. Hobby project which was initially started in order to practice with React/Typescript/Sockets, but later became a challenge :)

Due to some challenge rules, no canvas/threejs or similar intruments were used and all the game processes are handled via DOM elements and CSS transfomations.
